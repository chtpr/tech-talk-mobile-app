# TechTalk

## Description
An Android app that provides users a community where they can share tech tutorials with one another. Three main features are implemented: Resources, Collections, and Learning Paths. Resources are the tutorials that populate our app. Collections are catalogs of Resources grouped together. Learning Paths are Resources that are presented in sequential order, e.g. Java I, Java II. Users can create, read, update, and delete user profiles and tutorials. Mobile UI features such as RecyclerView, Fragments, NavController, and various buttons, toggles, and text inputs are implemented.
